# Pumas and Hares
This repository is the outcome of a group project for the Programming Skills class in the 2018 High Performance Computing Masters at Edinburgh University. The program held is this repository is  a two-dimensional predator-prey model with spatial diffusion using C++. The aim was to produce a “best 
practice” scientific code within a full development framework (i.e. revision control, build tools, unit test 
framework etc.). 
## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
gcc
make
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

## Building

* [C Make](http://www.dropwizard.io/1.0.2/docs/) - The web framework used

## Running the tests

To build and run these tests, simply use the command `make test`

### Break down into end to end tests

Each test file examines the methods of its parent class


### Coding style

```
	class MyClass {

	}

	int myFunc(int my_var) { //whitespace between ) and {
	    return my_var; //var name words seperated by _
	}
```
