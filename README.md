# Pumas and Hares
This repository is the outcome of a group project for the Programming Skills class in the 2018 High Performance Computing Masters at Edinburgh University. The program held is this repository is  a two-dimensional predator-prey model with spatial diffusion using C++. The aim was to produce a “best 
practice” scientific code within a full development framework (i.e. revision control, build tools, unit test, framework etc.). 

### Prerequisites
```
Compiler: g++
Debug: gdb
Build tool: make
Test tool: 
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
make all
make run
make tests
```

## Building

* [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) - The web framework used

## Platforms

The simulations run on both DICE and Cirrus supercomputers

## Third Party Tools

* [Catch](https://catch-lib.net) for the test library
* [JSON](https://catch-lib.net) for the json parser library

## Running the tests

To build and run these tests, simply use the command `make test`

### Break down into end to end tests

Each test file examines the methods of its parent class

### Coding style

```
class MyClass {
	int myFunc(int myVar) {
	    return myVar;
	}
}
```

### Documentation

C++ header files contain in line documentation
